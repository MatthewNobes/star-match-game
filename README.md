# Star Match Game

This was another application I made as part of my React training. It is a small maths game that is kicked off whenever the user loads the page. They are given a set amount of time to complete the game, by selecting numbers that match up the number of starts on the screen, until all numbers have been used.

I plan to upgrade this application in the future when I get time, by adding a system for an easy, medium and hard game, each with a different second count. I also want to setup the game so it has a start count down so the user is ready when the game begins. This project could also do with being divided up into separate components a bit better too.
